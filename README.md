An  AI  powered  chatbot  will  be  spawned  inside  the  website  when  students  face difficulties while filling up application forms. Aspiring students will be able to chat with  this  bot  in  natural  language  to  get  their  queries  resolved.  Bot  can  also  help admitted students  select  and  enroll  to  courses.  The  NLP  and  Machine  Learning capabilities  of  api.ai  will  be  utilized  to  create  this  conversational  agent.  A  cloud based gateway will reside in campus. It will be developed using NodeJS /java and spring-boot. This gateway will interact with APIs exposed by api.ai, and also act as an  interacting  mediumfor  various  clients  such  as  web  based  chatbot,  mobile  app based   chatbot,   Facebook   messenger   bot,   etc.   Essentially,   using   centralized intelligence, we will be about to serve students through various channels and reduce the resolution time of queries. In case the bot is unable to answer or isnâ€™t confident enough, the bot will trigger an email on behalf of student to the concerned faculty that can answer the same. This ensuresthat students will not be misguided and will be able to get queries resolved in any circumstances.
